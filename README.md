# Machine Learning Projects 

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository showcases various applications of machine learning techniques across different domains, including natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

This repository contains the following key files:

- `GPT-Neo-1.3B.py`: Implementation of the GPT-Neo 1.3B model for text generation tasks.
- `transformer_GPT-2.py`: Implementation of the GPT-2 transformer model for language modeling.
- `tokenizer.py` & `prediction_tokenizer.py`: Scripts for tokenizing input data for transformer models.

## üß† Project Highlights

### 1. **GPT-Neo-1.3B Model**

- **Objective**: Develop a text generation model capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
- **Approach**: Utilized the GPT-Neo 1.3B model, a transformer-based architecture, to train on a diverse text corpus.
- **Outcome**: Achieved significant improvements in text coherence and contextual relevance compared to baseline models.

### 2. **GPT-2 Transformer Model**

- **Objective**: Implement the GPT-2 model for language modeling and text generation tasks.
- **Approach**: Leveraged the transformer architecture to capture long-range dependencies in text data.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated the model's ability to generate human-like text across various prompts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers`: For implementing transformer-based models.
  - `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning.
